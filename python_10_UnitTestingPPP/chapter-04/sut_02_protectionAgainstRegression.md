# protection against regressions

an unfortunate fact of programming life is that `code is NOT an asset, it's a liability`

to evaluate how well a test scores on the metric of protecting against regressions, u need to take into account the following:

- the amount of code that is executed during the test
- the complexity of that code
- the code's domain significance
