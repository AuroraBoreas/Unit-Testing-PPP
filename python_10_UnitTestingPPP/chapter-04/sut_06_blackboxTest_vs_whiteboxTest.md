# choosing between black-blox and white-box testing

- black-box testing is a method of software testing that examines the functionality of a system w/o knowing its internal structure. such testing is normally built around specifications and requirements: `what` the application is supposed to do, rather than `how` it does it.
- white-box testing is the opposite of that. it's a method of testing that verifies the application's inner workings. the tests are derived from the source code, not requirements or specifications.

Table: black-box testing vs white-box testing

(well, i dont think this table is always true)

| method                       | protection against regressions    | resistance to refactoring |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| black-box testing            | good                              | bad?                      |
| white-box testing            | bad                               | good                      |
