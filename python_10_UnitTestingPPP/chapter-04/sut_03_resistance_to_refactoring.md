# resistance to refactoring

resistance to refactoing -- the degree to which a test can sustain a refactoring of the underlying applicatino code w/o turning red (failing).


refactoring means changing existing code w/o modifying its observable behavior.

the intention is usually to improve the code's nonfunctional characteristics: increase readability and reduce complexity.

some examples of refactoring are renaming a method and extracting a piece of code into a new class.
