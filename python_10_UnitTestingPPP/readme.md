# Overvew

why do i read several books, watch videos and listen talks
about unittest?

because i found it's interesting that w/o understanding the basic concepts behind unittest, every time i feel lost after see several examples or write some test code.

it's retard, malicious to me. As every time, i have to look up to documentation to find why? it wastes my energy and repeat myself. it's stupid af.

## what is unittest

under the hood of modern techniques, everything could be disassembled into separate pieces or units.

these units somehow have their own isolation environment and functionalities.

we combine all of them and assemble into a final product.

this process or vise verse is the foundation of modern industry world.

unittest is a framework to test and verify functionalities of units in all possible situations. we review the test result, refactor our code.

you may ask how do u we create "unit-like" component?

it's a very good question.

i recommend to read some books about this theme.

- Code Complete by Steve McConnel
- Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable, Object-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma

my personal goal is "acid"  plus "arm" after reading.

- atom
- consistency
- isolation
- durability
- automated
- readable
- maintainable

## why unittest

if unittest exists, do u have an integratino test(counterpart, pairs w/e)?

short answer is yes

ultimate goal is to write beautifu and correct code.

the code is automated, readable and maintainable.

but wait a second, how are u sure that your code is correct in the first place?

human being is prone to make mistakes always.

surely, human being may have keep peak performance and make zero mistaks for a short duration, but can't sustain a long term. performance is gonna be regression to normal status. again, human being occassionaly start making mistakes.

this is where unittest comes to inspect your code.

it supports you to write code well and durable.

## how to use unittest

here we go.

1. we design our diagram. "acid" laws enter the chat
2. we write our code according to the diagram. "arm" laws come in.
3. we test our code.
4. if not good, we jump to step 1 and repeat
5. if good, we done
